neo4j.source-strategy=Type: Enum<QUERY, CDC>;\nDescription: Source strategy for this connector.
neo4j.batch-size=Type: Integer;\nDescription: Maximum number of change events to publish for each poll cycle.
neo4j.start-from=Type: Enum<EARLIEST, NOW, USER_PROVIDED>;\nDescription: A time anchor to start streaming from.
neo4j.start-from.value=Type: STRING|LONG;\nDescription: Custom value to use as a starting offset. \
  Used once during the initial run of the connector, and will be ignored if there is an offset stored in Kafka Connect.
neo4j.ignore-stored-offset=Type: Boolean;\nDescription: Whether to ignore any offset value retrieved from the offset storage saved by a previous run.
neo4j.query=Type: String;\nDescription: Cypher query to use for gathering changes. \
  Requires both `neo4j.query.streaming-property` to be in the result set, and `$lastCheck` query parameter used for tracking changes.
neo4j.query.streaming-property=Type: String;\nDescription: Property name that is both present in the result set of the specified query \
  and used as a filter to query changes from a previous value.
neo4j.query.poll-duration=Type: String;\nDescription: Maximum amount of time Kafka Connect poll request will wait for a change to be received from the database (valid units are: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`; default unit is `s`).
neo4j.query.poll-interval=Type: String;\nDescription: Interval in which the query is executed during `neo4j.query.poll-duration` timespan (valid units are: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`; default unit is `s`).
neo4j.query.topic=Type: String;\nDescription: Kafka topic to publish change events gathered through provided query.
neo4j.query.timeout=Type: Duration;\nDescription: Maximum amount of time query is allowed to run (valid units are: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`; default unit is `s`).
neo4j.cdc.poll-duration=Type: Duration;\nDescription: Maximum amount of time Kafka Connect poll request will wait for a change to be received from the database (valid units are: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`; default unit is `s`).
neo4j.cdc.poll-interval=Type: Duration;\nDescription: The interval in which the database will be polled for changes (valid units are: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`; default unit is `s`).
neo4j.temporal-schema.type=Type: Enum<STRUCT, STRING>;\nDescription: Schema type for temporal data. \
  If set to STRUCT, temporal data is converted into a connector defined struct object. If set to STRING, temporal data is converted into a string using the ISO standard.
